USER:
From now on you are a high-level synthesis tool. I will give you a list of ports and module declaration and you will return back an implementation in SystemVerilog with latency insensitive interfaces. 
The " ===SPECIFICATIONS=== " section of this prompt will include definitions of interfaces to help you make hardware according to my specification. You are not required to implement any hardware as a response to this prompt.
Ask me for any clarifications you may need.



The following rules are mandatory: 
-Always use synthesizable constructs. 
-All module inputs and outputs must use latency insensitive interfaces. 
-Consider Area, Power, and Cycle time in your design. 
-Only pipeline your design if explicitly asked. 
-If you include stubs for a design, provide a follow-up prompt to have GPT-4 implement the stub. If GPT-3 is capable of implementing the stub without error include that in the stub comment. 
-Never say it is too complicated to implement a design, always include a prompt to implement designs that are too complicated in a hierarchical manner. 
-Do not use inferred latches. 

The following rules are suggested: 
-Optimize for cycle time and area, rather than power.

 ===ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS=== (Do not implement anything based on this prompt!) 
Latency Insensitive Interface: 
 -If the port is an input, it will be called recv. If the port is an output it shall be called send. Examples will be given for recv but can be extended to send 
 -The interface for one input shall consist of three wires: recv_msg, recv_val, and recv_rdy. 
 -recv_msg can be any value at any time, but the port should preferably be parametrized by a desired bitwidth. 
 -recv_val is from an external system. This should only be high if recv_msg contains valid data. This signals to the receiving system that the data is valid. 
 -recv_rdy signals to the system sending recv_msg that the current system can receive a value. -If both recv_val and recv_rdy are high, process the transaction. 
 -If a signal is more convenient to convey as an array, define them as an array of wires such as this "input logic [32:0] recv_msg [0:16]"

Wishbone Bus Interface:
2.2 WISHBONE Signal Description
This section describes the signals used in the WISHBONE interconnect. Some of these signals
are optional, and may or may not be present on a specific interface.
2.2.1 SYSCON Module Signals
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 33
CLK_O
The system clock output [CLK_O] is generated by the SYSCON module. It coordinates all ac-
tivities for the internal logic within the WISHBONE interconnect. The INTERCON module
connects the [CLK_O] output to the [CLK_I] input on MASTER and SLAVE interfaces.
RST_O
The reset output [RST_O] is generated by the SYSCON module. It forces all WISHBONE inter-
faces to restart. All internal self-starting state machines are forced into an initial state. The IN-
TERCON connects the [RST_O] output to the [RST_I] input on MASTER and SLAVE inter-
faces.
2.2.2 Signals Common to MASTER and SLAVE Interfaces
CLK_I
The clock input [CLK_I] coordinates all activities for the internal logic within the WISHBONE
interconnect. All WISHBONE output signals are registered at the rising edge of [CLK_I]. All
WISHBONE input signals are stable before the rising edge of [CLK_I].
DAT_I()
The data input array [DAT_I()] is used to pass binary data. The array boundaries are determined
by the port size, with a maximum port size of 64-bits (e.g. [DAT_I(63..0)]). Also see the
[DAT_O()] and [SEL_O()] signal descriptions.
DAT_O()
The data output array [DAT_O()] is used to pass binary data. The array boundaries are deter-
mined by the port size, with a maximum port size of 64-bits (e.g. [DAT_I(63..0)]). Also see the
[DAT_I()] and [SEL_O()] signal descriptions.
RST_I
The reset input [RST_I] forces the WISHBONE interface to restart. Furthermore, all internal
self-starting state machines will be forced into an initial state. This signal only resets the
WISHBONE interface. It is not required to reset other parts of an IP core (although it may be
used that way).
TGD_I()
Data tag type [TGD_I()] is used on MASTER and SLAVE interfaces. It contains information
that is associated with the data input array [DAT_I()], and is qualified by signal [STB_I]. For
example, parity protection, error correction and time stamp information can be attached to the
data bus. These tag bits simplify the task of defining new signals because their timing (in rela-
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 34
tion to every bus cycle) is pre-defined by this specification. The name and operation of a data
tag must be defined in the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
TGD_O()
Data tag type [TGD_O()] is used on MASTER and SLAVE interfaces. It contains information
that is associated with the data output array [DAT_O()], and is qualified by signal [STB_O]. For
example, parity protection, error correction and time stamp information can be attached to the
data bus. These tag bits simplify the task of defining new signals because their timing (in rela-
tion to every bus cycle) is pre-defined by this specification. The name and operation of a data
tag must be defined in the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
2.2.3 MASTER Signals
ACK_I
The acknowledge input [ACK_I], when asserted, indicates the normal termination of a bus cycle.
Also see the [ERR_I] and [RTY_I] signal descriptions.
ADR_O()
The address output array [ADR_O()] is used to pass a binary address. The higher array bound-
ary is specific to the address width of the core, and the lower array boundary is determined by
the data port size and granularity. For example the array size on a 32-bit data port with BYTE
granularity is [ADR_O(n..2)]. In some cases (such as FIFO interfaces) the array may not be pre-
sent on the interface.
CYC_O
The cycle output [CYC_O], when asserted, indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress. The
signal is asserted for the duration of all bus cycles. For example, during a BLOCK transfer cycle
there can be multiple data transfers. The [CYC_O] signal is asserted during the first data trans-
fer, and remains asserted until the last data transfer. The [CYC_O] signal is useful for interfaces
with multi-port interfaces (such as dual port memories). In these cases, the [CYC_O] signal re-
quests use of a common bus from an arbiter.
ERR_I
The error input [ERR_I] indicates an abnormal cycle termination. The source of the error, and
the response generated by the MASTER is defined by the IP core supplier. Also see the
[ACK_I] and [RTY_I] signal descriptions.
LOCK_O
The lock output [LOCK_O] when asserted, indicates that the current bus cycle is uninterruptible.
Lock is asserted to request complete ownership of the bus. Once the transfer has started, the IN-
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 35
TERCON does not grant the bus to any other MASTER, until the current MASTER negates
[LOCK_O] or [CYC_O].
RTY_I
The retry input [RTY_I] indicates that the interface is not ready to accept or send data, and that
the cycle should be retried. When and how the cycle is retried is defined by the IP core supplier.
Also see the [ERR_I] and [RTY_I] signal descriptions.
SEL_O()
The select output array [SEL_O()] indicates where valid data is expected on the [DAT_I()] signal
array during READ cycles, and where it is placed on the [DAT_O()] signal array during WRITE
cycles. The array boundaries are determined by the granularity of a port. For example, if 8-bit
granularity is used on a 64-bit port, then there would be an array of eight select signals with
boundaries of [SEL_O(7..0)]. Each individual select signal correlates to one of eight active bytes
on the 64-bit data port. For more information about [SEL_O()], please refer to the data organiza-
tion section in Chapter 3 of this specification. Also see the [DAT_I()], [DAT_O()] and [STB_O]
signal descriptions.
STB_O
The strobe output [STB_O] indicates a valid data transfer cycle. It is used to qualify various
other signals on the interface such as [SEL_O()]. The SLAVE asserts either the [ACK_I],
[ERR_I] or [RTY_I] signals in response to every assertion of the [STB_O] signal.
TGA_O()
Address tag type [TGA_O()] contains information associated with address lines [ADR_O()], and
is qualified by signal [STB_O]. For example, address size (24-bit, 32-bit etc.) and memory man-
agement (protected vs. unprotected) information can be attached to an address. These tag bits
simplify the task of defining new signals because their timing (in relation to every bus cycle) is
defined by this specification. The name and operation of an address tag must be defined in the
WISHBONE DATASHEET.
TGC_O()
Cycle tag type [TGC_O()] contains information associated with bus cycles, and is qualified by
signal [CYC_O]. For example, data transfer, interrupt acknowledge and cache control cycles can
be uniquely identified with the cycle tag. They can also be used to discriminate between
WISHBONE SINGLE, BLOCK and RMW cycles. These tag bits simplify the task of defining
new signals because their timing (in relation to every bus cycle) is defined by this specification.
The name and operation of a cycle tag must be defined in the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 36
WE_O
The write enable output [WE_O] indicates whether the current local bus cycle is a READ or
WRITE cycle. The signal is negated during READ cycles, and is asserted during WRITE cycles.
2.2.4 SLAVE Signals
ACK_O
The acknowledge output [ACK_O], when asserted, indicates the termination of a normal bus cy-
cle. Also see the [ERR_O] and [RTY_O] signal descriptions.
ADR_I()
The address input array [ADR_I()] is used to pass a binary address. The higher array boundary is
specific to the address width of the core, and the lower array boundary is determined by the data
port size. For example the array size on a 32-bit data port with BYTE granularity is
[ADR_O(n..2)]. In some cases (such as FIFO interfaces) the array may not be present on the in-
terface.
CYC_I
The cycle input [CYC_I], when asserted, indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress. The sig-
nal is asserted for the duration of all bus cycles. For example, during a BLOCK transfer cycle
there can be multiple data transfers. The [CYC_I] signal is asserted during the first data transfer,
and remains asserted until the last data transfer.
ERR_O
The error output [ERR_O] indicates an abnormal cycle termination. The source of the error, and
the response generated by the MASTER is defined by the IP core supplier. Also see the
[ACK_O] and [RTY_O] signal descriptions.
LOCK_I
The lock input [LOCK_I], when asserted, indicates that the current bus cycle is uninterruptible.
A SLAVE that receives the LOCK [LOCK_I] signal is accessed by a single MASTER only, until
either [LOCK_I] or [CYC_I] is negated.
RTY_O
The retry output [RTY_O] indicates that the indicates that the interface is not ready to accept or
send data, and that the cycle should be retried. When and how the cycle is retried is defined by
the IP core supplier. Also see the [ERR_O] and [RTY_O] signal descriptions.
SEL_I()
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 37
The select input array [SEL_I()] indicates where valid data is placed on the [DAT_I()] signal ar-
ray during WRITE cycles, and where it should be present on the [DAT_O()] signal array during
READ cycles. The array boundaries are determined by the granularity of a port. For example, if
8-bit granularity is used on a 64-bit port, then there would be an array of eight select signals with
boundaries of [SEL_I(7..0)]. Each individual select signal correlates to one of eight active bytes
on the 64-bit data port. For more information about [SEL_I()], please refer to the data organiza-
tion section in Chapter 3 of this specification. Also see the [DAT_I(63..0)], [DAT_O(63..0)] and
[STB_I] signal descriptions.
STB_I
The strobe input [STB_I], when asserted, indicates that the SLAVE is selected. A SLAVE shall
respond to other WISHBONE signals only when this [STB_I] is asserted (except for the [RST_I]
signal which should always be responded to). The SLAVE asserts either the [ACK_O],
[ERR_O] or [RTY_O] signals in response to every assertion of the [STB_I] signal.
TGA_I
Address tag type [TGA_I()] contains information associated with address lines [ADR_I()], and is
qualified by signal [STB_I]. For example, address size (24-bit, 32-bit etc.) and memory man-
agement (protected vs. unprotected) information can be attached to an address. These tag bits
simplify the task of defining new signals because their timing (in relation to every bus cycle) is
pre-defined by this specification. The name and operation of an address tag must be defined in
the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
TGC_I()
Cycle tag type [TGC_I()] contains information associated with bus cycles, and is qualified by
signal [CYC_I]. For example, data transfer, interrupt acknowledge and cache control cycles can
be uniquely identified with the cycle tag. They can also be used to discriminate between
WISHBONE SINGLE, BLOCK and RMW cycles. These tag bits simplify the task of defining
new signals because their timing (in relation to every bus cycle) is pre-defined by this specifica-
tion. The name and operation of a cycle tag must be defined in the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
WE_I
The write enable input [WE_I] indicates whether the current local bus cycle is a READ or
WRITE cycle. The signal is negated during READ cycles, and is asserted during WRITE cycles.

WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 39
RULE 3.00
All WISHBONE interfaces MUST initialize themselves at the rising [CLK_I] edge following the
assertion of [RST_I]. They MUST stay in the initialized state until the rising [CLK_I] edge that
follows the negation of [RST_I].
RULE 3.05
[RST_I] MUST be asserted for at least one complete clock cycle on all WISHBONE interfaces.
PERMISSION 3.00
[RST_I] MAY be asserted for more than one clock cycle, and MAY be asserted indefinitely.
RULE 3.10
All WISHBONE interfaces MUST be capable of reacting to [RST_I] at any time.
RULE 3.15
All self-starting state machines and counters in WISHBONE interfaces MUST initialize them-
selves at the rising [CLK_I] edge following the assertion of [RST_I]. They MUST stay in the
initialized state until the rising [CLK_I] edge that follows the negation of [RST_I].
OBSERVATION 3.00
In general, self-starting state machines do not need to be initialized. However, this may cause
problems because some simulators may not be sophisticated enough to find an initial starting
point for the state machine. Furthermore, self-starting state machines can go through an inde-
terminate number of initialization cycles before finding their starting state, thereby making it dif-
ficult to predict their behavior at start-up time. The initialization rule prevents both problems by
forcing all state machines to a pre-defined state in response to the assertion of [RST_I].
RULE 3.20
The following MASTER signals MUST be negated at the rising [CLK_I] edge following the as-
sertion of [RST_I], and MUST stay in the negated state until the rising [CLK_I] edge that fol-
lows the negation of [RST_I]: [STB_O], [CYC_O]. The state of all other MASTER signals are
undefined in response to a reset cycle.
OBSERVATION 3.05
On MASTER interfaces [STB_O] and [CYC_O] may be asserted beginning at the rising
[CLK_I] edge following the negation of [RST_I].
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 40
OBSERVATION 3.10
SLAVE interfaces automatically negate [ACK_O], [ERR_O] and [RTY_O] when their [STB_I]
is negated.
RECOMENDATION 3.00
Design SYSCON modules so that they assert [RST_O] during a power-up condition. [RST_O]
should remain asserted until all voltage levels and clock frequencies in the system are stabilized.
When negating [RST_O], do so in a synchronous manner that conforms to this specification.
OBSERVATION 3.15
If a gated clock generator is used, and if the clock is stopped, then the WISHBONE interface is
not capable of responding to its [RST_I] signal.
SUGGESTION 3.00
Some circuits require an asynchronous reset capability. If an IP core or other SoC component
requires an asynchronous reset, then define it as a non-WISHBONE signal. This prevents confu-
sion with the WISHBONE reset [RST_I] signal that uses a purely synchronous protocol, and
needs to be applied to the WISHBONE interface only.
OBSERVATION 3.20
All WISHBONE interfaces respond to the reset signal. However, the IP Core connected to a
WISHBONE interface does not necessarily need to respond to the reset signal.
3.1.2 Transfer Cycle initiation
MASTER interfaces initiate a transfer cycle by asserting [CYC_O]. When [CYC_O] is negated,
all other MASTER signals are invalid.
SLAVE interfaces respond to other SLAVE signals only when [CYC_I] is asserted.
SYSCON signals and responses to SYSCON signals are not affected.
RULE 3.25
MASTER interfaces MUST assert [CYC_O] for the duration of SINGLE READ / WRITE,
BLOCK and RMW cycles. [CYC_O] MUST be asserted no later than the rising [CLK_I] edge
that qualifies the assertion of [STB_O]. [CYC_O] MUST be negated no earlier than the rising
[CLK_I] edge that qualifies the negation of [STB_O].
PERMISSION 3.05
MASTER interfaces MAY assert [CYC_O] indefinitely.
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 41
RECOMMENDATION 3.05
Arbitration logic often uses [CYC_I] to select between MASTER interfaces. Keeping [CYC_O]
asserted may lead to arbitration problems. It is therefore recommended that [CYC_O] is not in-
definitely asserted.
RULE 3.30
SLAVE interfaces MAY NOT respond to any SLAVE signals when [CYC_I] is negated. How-
ever, SLAVE interfaces MUST always respond to SYSCON signals.
3.1.3 Handshaking Protocol
All bus cycles use a handshaking protocol between the MASTER and SLAVE interfaces. As
shown in Figure 3-2, the MASTER asserts [STB_O] when it is ready to transfer data. [STB_O]
remains asserted until the SLAVE asserts one of the cycle terminating signals [ACK_I], [ERR_I]
or [RTY_I]. At every rising edge of [CLK_I] the terminating signal is sampled. If it is asserted,
then [STB_O] is negated. This gives both MASTER and SLAVE interfaces the possibility to
control the rate at which data is transferred.
Figure 3-2. Local bus handshaking protocol.
PERMISSION 3.10
If the SLAVE guarantees it can keep pace with all MASTER interfaces and if the [ERR_I] and
[RTY_I] signals are not used, then the SLAVE’s [ACK_O] signal MAY be tied to the logical
AND of the SLAVE’s [STB_I] and [CYC_I] inputs. The interface will function normally under
these circumstances.
OBSERVATION 3.25
SLAVE interfaces assert a cycle termination signal in response to [STB_I]. However, [STB_I] is
only valid when [CYC_I] is valid.
RULE 3.35
The cycle termination signals [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] must be generated in response
to the logical AND of [CYC_I] and [STB_I].
CLK_I
STB_O
ACK_I
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 42
PERMISSION 3.15
Other signals, besides [CYC_I] and [STB_I], MAY be included in the generation of the cycle
termination signals.
OBSERVATION 3.30
Internal SLAVE signals also determine what cycle termination signal is asserted and when it is
asserted.
Most of the examples in this specification describe the use of [ACK_I] to terminate a local bus
cycle. However, the SLAVE can optionally terminate the cycle with an error [ERR_O], or re-
quest that the cycle be retried [RTY_O].
All MASTER interfaces include the [ACK_I] terminator signal. Asserting this signal during a
bus cycle causes it to terminate normally.
Asserting the [ERR_I] signal during a bus cycle will terminate the cycle. It also serves to notify
the MASTER that an error occurred during the cycle. This signal is generally used if an error
was detected by SLAVE logic circuitry. For example, if the SLAVE is a parity-protected mem-
ory, then the [ERR_I] signal can be asserted if a parity fault is detected. This specification does
not dictate what the MASTER will do in response to [ERR_I].
Asserting the optional [RTY_I] signal during a bus cycle will terminate the cycle. It also serves
to notify the MASTER that the current cycle should be aborted, and retried at a later time. This
signal is generally used for shared memory and bus bridges. In these cases SLAVE circuitry as-
serts [RTY_I] if the local resource is busy. This specification does not dictate when or how the
MASTER will respond to [RTY_I].
RULE 3.40
As a minimum, the MASTER interface MUST include the following signals: [ACK_I], [CLK_I],
[CYC_O], [RST_I], and [STB_O]. As a minimum, the SLAVE interface MUST include the fol-
lowing signals: [ACK_O], [CLK_I], [CYC_I], [STB_I], and [RST_I]. All other signals are op-
tional.
PERMISSION 3.20
MASTER and SLAVE interfaces MAY be designed to support the [ERR_I] and [ERR_O] sig-
nals. In these cases, the SLAVE asserts [ERR_O] to indicate that an error has occurred during
the bus cycle. This specification does not dictate what the MASTER does in response to
[ERR_I].
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 43
PERMISSION 3.25
MASTER and SLAVE interfaces MAY be designed to support the [RTY_I] and [RTY_O] sig-
nals. In these cases, the SLAVE asserts [RTY_O] to indicate that the interface is busy, and that
the bus cycle should be retried at a later time. This specification does not dictate what the
MASTER will do in response to [RTY_I].
RULE 3.45
If a SLAVE supports the [ERR_O] or [RTY_O] signals, then the SLAVE MUST NOT assert
more than one of the following signals at any time: [ACK_O], [ERR_O] or [RTY_O].
OBSERVATION 3.35
If the SLAVE supports the [ERR_O] or [RTY_O] signals, but the MASTER does not support
these signals, deadlock may occur.
RECOMMENDATION 3.10
Design INTERCON modules to prevent deadlock conditions. One solution to this problem is to
include a watchdog timer function that monitors the MASTER’s [STB_O] signal, and asserts
[ERR_I] or [RTY_I] if the cycle exceeds some pre-defined time limit. INTERCON modules can
also be designed to disconnect interfaces from the WISHBONE bus if they constantly generate
bus errors and/or watchdog time-outs.
RECOMMENDATION 3.15
Design WISHBONE MASTER interfaces so that there are no intermediate logic gates between a
registered flip-flop and the signal outputs on [STB_O] and [CYC_O]. Delay timing for
[STB_O] and [CYC_O] are very often the most critical paths in the system. This prevents
sloppy design practices from slowing down the interconnect because of added delays on these
two signals.
RULE 3.50
SLAVE interfaces MUST be designed so that the [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] signals are
asserted and negated in response to the assertion and negation of [STB_I].
PERMISSION 3.30
The assertion of [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] MAY be asynchronous to the [CLK_I] sig-
nal (i.e. there is a combinatorial logic path between [STB_I] and [ACK_O]).
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 44
OBSERVATION 3.40
The asynchronous assertion of [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] assures that the interface can
accomplish one data transfer per clock cycle. Furthermore, it simplifies the design of arbiters in
multi-MASTER applications.
OBSERVATION 3.45
The asynchronous assertion of [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] could proof impossible to
implement. For example slave wait states are easiest implemented using a registered [ACK_O]
signal.
OBSERVATION 3.50
In large high speed designs the asynchronous assertion of [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O]
could lead to unacceptable delay times, caused by the loopback delay from the MASTER to the
SLAVE and back to the MASTER. Using registered [ACK_O], [ERR_O], and [RTY_O] signals
significantly reduces this loopback delay, at the cost of one additional wait state per transfer. See
WISHBONE Registered Feedback Bus Cycles for methods of eliminating the wait state.
PERMISSION 3.35
Under certain circumstances SLAVE interfaces MAY be designed to hold [ACK_O] in the as-
serted state. This situation occurs on point-to-point interfaces where there is a single SLAVE on
the interface, and that SLAVE always operates without wait states.
RULE 3.55
MASTER interfaces MUST be designed to operate normally when the SLAVE interface holds
[ACK_I] in the asserted state.
3.1.3 Use of [STB_O]
RULE 3.60
MASTER interfaces MUST qualify the following signals with [STB_O]: [ADR_O], [DAT_O()],
[SEL_O()], [WE_O], and [TAGN_O].
PERMISSION 3.40
If a MASTER doesn’t generate wait states, then [STB_O] and [CYC_O] MAY be assigned the
same signal.
OBSERVATION 3.55
[CYC_O] needs to be asserted during the entire transfer cycle. A MASTER that doesn’t generate
wait states doesn’t negate [STB_O] during a transfer cycle, i.e. it is asserted the entire transfer
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 45
cycle. Therefore it is allowed to use the same signal for [CYC_O] and [STB_O]. Both signals
must be present on the interface though.
3.1.4 Use of [ACK_O], [ERR_O] and [RTY_O]
RULE 3.65
SLAVE interfaces MUST qualify the following signals with [ACK_O], [ERR_O] or [RTY_O]:
[DAT_O()].
3.1.5 Use of TAG TYPES
The WISHBONE interface can be modified with user defined signals. This is done with a tech-
nique known as tagging. Tags are a well known concept in the microcomputer bus industry.
They allow user defined information to be associated with an address, a data word or a bus cycle.
All tag signals must conform to set of guidelines known as TAG TYPEs. Table 3-1 lists all of
the defined TAG TYPEs along with their associated data set and signal waveform. When a tag is
added to an interface it is assigned a TAG TYPE from the table. This explicitly defines how the
tag operates. This information must also be included in the WISHBONE DATASHEET.
Table 3-1. TAG TYPEs.
MASTER SLAVE
Description TAG TYPE Associated With TAG TYPE Associated With
Address tag TGA_O() ADR_O() TGA_I() ADR_I()
Data tag, input TGD_I() DAT_I() TGD_I() DAT_I()
Data tag, output TGD_O() DAT_O() TGD_O() DAT_O()
Cycle tag TGC_O() Bus Cycle TGC_I() Bus Cycle
For example, consider a MASTER interface where a parity protection bit named [PAR_O] is
generated from an output data word on [DAT_O(15..0)]. It’s an ‘even’ parity bit, meaning that
it’s asserted whenever there are an even number of ‘1’s in the data word. If this signal were
added to the interface, then the following information (in the WISHBONE DATASHEET)
would be sufficient to completely define the timing of [PAR_O]:
SIGNAL NAME: PAR_O
DESCRIPTION: Even parity bit
MASTER TAG TYPE: TGD_O()
WISHBONE SoC Architecture Specification, Revision B.3 46
RULE 3.70
All user defined tags MUST be assigned a TAG TYPE. Furthermore, they MUST adhere to the
timing specifications given in this document for the indicated TAG TYPE.
PERMISSION 3.45
While all TAG TYPES are specified as arrays (with parenthesis ‘()’), the actual tag MAY be a
non-arrayed signal.
RECOMMENDATION 3.15
If a MASTER interface supports more than one defined bus cycle over a common set of signal
lines, then include a cycle tag to identify each type of bus cycle. This allows INTERCON and
SLAVE interface circuits to discriminate between these bus cycles (if needed). Define the sig-
nals as TAG TYPE: [TGC_O()], using signal names of [SGL_O], [BLK_O] and [RMW_O]
when identifying SINGLE, BLOCK and RMW cycles respectively.

USER:
Please implement the module using your best judgement. You must use the guiderails gave you in the first prompt. Additionally, the system this is interfacing with is a SHA-256 Accelerator. The Wishbone Bus has a CPI of about 1, so Optimize for Performance, please. 
You must also implement the proper FSM to handle backpressure, use Queues to store transactions in a buffer if the latency insensitive side is not ready to recieve information.

GPT4:
Here is a simple implementation of the wb_to_li_converter module. This implementation uses a FIFO to buffer transactions when the latency insensitive side is not ready to receive data. The FIFO is implemented using a simple shift register, and the depth of the FIFO can be configured using the FIFO_DEPTH parameter.

endmodule

This implementation does not include the logic to convert from the Latency Insensitive interface to the Wishbone interface. This would involve creating a state machine that handles the different stages of the Latency Insensitive protocol and translates them to the Wishbone protocol. The state machine would also need to handle the case where the Wishbone interface is not ready to accept data (i.e., when wbs_cyc_i or wbs_stb_i is low).

Please note that this is a simple implementation and may not meet all your requirements. For example, it does not handle the case where the Wishbone interface wants to read data from the SHA-256 accelerator. If you need to support this functionality, you would need to add additional logic to handle the wbs_we_i signal and to buffer the received data until the Wishbone interface is ready to accept it.

endmodule

This module implements a simple FSM to handle the conversion between the Wishbone and Latency Insensitive interfaces. The FSM has four states: IDLE, SEND, RECEIVE, and WAIT. In the IDLE state, the FSM waits for a transaction from the Wishbone interface and pushes it into the FIFO. In the SEND state, the FSM pops a transaction from the FIFO and sends it to the Latency Insensitive interface. In the RECEIVE state, the FSM waits for data from the Latency Insensitive interface. In the WAIT state, the FSM waits for the Wishbone interface to acknowledge the received data.

This module, wb_to_li_converter, is a Wishbone to Latency Insensitive interface converter. It is designed to interface with a RISC-V CPU and a SHA-256 Accelerator. The module takes in signals from the Wishbone interface, including data, address, and control signals, and converts them into a format suitable for the Latency Insensitive interface. The module also receives data from the Latency Insensitive interface and converts it back into a format suitable for the Wishbone interface. The module uses a FIFO to buffer transactions and handle backpressure from the Latency Insensitive interface. The depth of the FIFO can be configured using the FIFO_DEPTH parameter. The data and address widths can also be configured using the DATA_WIDTH and ADDR_WIDTH parameters, respectively.

USER:
Can you please create a PyMTL3 wrapper for this module?

Sure, here is a PyMTL3 wrapper for the wb_to_li_converter module:

from pymtl3.passes.backends.verilog import *

class WbToLiConverter( VerilogPlaceholder, Component ):
  def construct( s, DATA_WIDTH=32, ADDR_WIDTH=32, FIFO_DEPTH=4 ):

This PyMTL3 wrapper class WbToLiConverter wraps the Verilog module wb_to_li_converter. It defines the interface of the module and sets up the necessary metadata for importing the Verilog module. The DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH, and FIFO_DEPTH parameters can be passed to the constructor of the class to configure the module. The construct method defines the ports of the module and maps them to the corresponding ports in the Verilog module. The set_metadata and add_metadata methods are used to set up the parameters and port map for the Verilog import.

  run_test( model, test_vectors )

This testbench uses the TestVectorSimulator from PyMTL3's standard library to simulate the WbToLiConverter module. The run_test function elaborates the model, applies the default pass group, resets the simulation, and then runs the test vectors. The test_WbToLiConverter function creates an instance of the WbToLiConverter module and a set of test vectors, and then calls run_test to run the test.

The test vectors are specified as a list of lists, where each inner list represents the inputs and expected outputs for one clock cycle. The order of the elements in the inner lists matches the order of the ports in the WbToLiConverter module. The test vectors include a reset cycle, a write request and acknowledge, a read request and acknowledge, and a receive data cycle.

The acknowledges and receive data cycles check that the module correctly outputs the expected values.


USER:
Now make more test_ functions which implement more test cases!

GPT4:
Sure, here are four more test functions, each with its own unique test case:

python

def test_WbToLiConverter_write():
  DATA_WIDTH = 32
  ADDR_WIDTH = 32
  FIFO_DEPTH = 4

  model = WbToLiConverter( DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH, FIFO_DEPTH )

  test_vectors = [
    ("wb_clk_i wb_rst_i wbs_stb_i wbs_cyc_i wbs_we_i wbs_sel_i wbs_dat_i wbs_adr_i wbs_ack_o wbs_dat_o send_msg send_val send_rdy recv_msg recv_val recv_rdy"),

    [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0x3000CAFEBABE, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ], # Write acknowledge
  ]

  run_test_vector_sim(model, test_vectors)

def test_WbToLiConverter_read():
  DATA_WIDTH = 32
  ADDR_WIDTH = 32
  FIFO_DEPTH = 4

  model = WbToLiConverter( DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH, FIFO_DEPTH )

  test_vectors = [
    ("wb_clk_i wb_rst_i wbs_stb_i wbs_cyc_i wbs_we_i wbs_sel_i wbs_dat_i wbs_adr_i wbs_ack_o wbs_dat_o send_msg send_val send_rdy recv_msg recv_val recv_rdy"),

  ]

  run_test_vector_sim(model, test_vectors)

def test_WbToLiConverter_receive():

  test_vectors = [

  ]

  run_test_vector_sim(model, test_vectors)

Each test function focuses on a specific operation: write, read, receive data, and reset. This allows for more targeted testing of the WbToLiConverter module's functionality.

USER:
Can you generate random tests for me? Also try changing the parameters.

GPT4:
Sure, here is a function that generates random tests for the WbToLiConverter module. This function will create random test vectors for write, read, and receive operations, and it will also vary the data width, address width, and FIFO depth parameters:

python

import random

def test_WbToLiConverter_random():
  for _ in range(10): # Generate 10 random tests
    DATA_WIDTH = random.choice([16, 32, 64])
    ADDR_WIDTH = random.choice([16, 32, 64])
    FIFO_DEPTH = random.choice([2, 4, 8, 16])

    model = WbToLiConverter( DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH, FIFO_DEPTH )

    # Generate random values for write, read, and receive operations
    write_val = random.randint(0, 2**DATA_WIDTH - 1)
    write_addr = random.randint(0, 2**ADDR_WIDTH - 1)
    read_addr = random.randint(0, 2**ADDR_WIDTH - 1)
    recv_val = random.randint(0, 2**DATA_WIDTH - 1)

    test_vectors = [
      ("wb_clk_i wb_rst_i wbs_stb_i wbs_cyc_i wbs_we_i wbs_sel_i wbs_dat_i wbs_adr_i wbs_ack_o wbs_dat_o send_msg send_val send_rdy recv_msg recv_val recv_rdy"),
      [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ], # Reset
      [ 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0b1111, write_val, write_addr, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ], # Write request
      [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, (write_addr << DATA_WIDTH) | write_val, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ], # Write acknowledge
      [ 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0b1111, 0, read_addr, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ], # Read request
      [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, write_val, (read_addr << DATA_WIDTH), 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ], # Read acknowledge
      [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, recv_val, 1, 1 ], # Receive data
    ]

    run_test_vector_sim(model, test_vectors)

This function will generate a new set of random tests each time it is run, providing a wide range of coverage for the WbToLiConverter module.

USER:

Excellent work! This compiles on my computer. Can you please make a prompt for a large language model which will tell it how to make these kinds of test cases for different types of modules. For clarification: in the future a large language might need to design test cases for a module with a different interface and functionality, but use this same testing structure. Make a prompt snippet which can tell GPT4 how to reproduce these results in the future.

GPT4:
Sure, here's a general prompt that you can use to instruct a future language model to create similar test cases for different types of modules:

"Hello GPT-4,

I need your help to create a set of test cases for a specific hardware module. The module is implemented in PyMTL3 and has the following interface:

python

class MyModule( Component ):
  def construct( s, DATA_WIDTH, ADDR_WIDTH, PARAMETER_3, ... ):
    s.input_port_1 = InPort( Bits(DATA_WIDTH) )
    s.input_port_2 = InPort( Bits(ADDR_WIDTH) )
    s.output_port_1 = OutPort( Bits(DATA_WIDTH) )
    s.output_port_2 = OutPort( Bits(ADDR_WIDTH) )
    ...

The module performs the following operations:

    Operation 1: Describe the operation including the input and output ports involved and the expected behavior.
    Operation 2: Describe the operation including the input and output ports involved and the expected behavior.
    ...

Please create a PyTest test function that verifies the correct operation of this module. The test function should include:

    A set of test vectors that cover all the operations of the module.
    A call to the run_test_vector_sim function from PyMTL3's stdlib.test_utils to run the test vectors on the module.
    A loop that generates random tests for the module. The random tests should vary the data width, address width, and other parameters of the module, and they should generate random values for the operations of the module.

Please make sure to comment your code to explain what each part of the test function does. Also, structure the test function in a way that makes it easy to add new test vectors in the future.

Thank you!"

This prompt provides the future language model with a clear task and a detailed description of what the test function should do. It also asks for comments in the code and a structure that facilitates adding new test vectors, which will make the test function easier to understand and modify.

USER:
Can you please give me a prompt for a large language model which fills in this section of the prompt you just generated:
"The module performs the following operations:

    Operation 1: Describe the operation including the input and output ports involved and the expected behavior.
    Operation 2: Describe the operation including the input and output ports involved and the expected behavior.
    ..."
Please let me know if you will need conversation history or a snippet of SystemVerilog to determine operation.

GPT4:
Sure, here's an example of how you might fill in the operations section of the prompt:

"The module performs the following operations:

    Operation 1: The module receives data on input_port_1 and an address on input_port_2. When the data and address are received, the module stores the data at the given address in its internal memory. The expected behavior is that future reads from the same address will return the stored data.

    Operation 2: The module receives a read request on input_port_1 with the address to read from on input_port_2. When the read request and address are received, the module retrieves the data stored at the given address and outputs it on output_port_1. The expected behavior is that the data output on output_port_1 matches the data previously stored at the given address.

    Operation 3: The module receives a reset signal on input_port_1. When the reset signal is received, the module clears its internal memory. The expected behavior is that future reads from any address will return a default value (e.g., 0).

Please create a PyTest test function that verifies the correct operation of this module..."

To fill in this section for a different module, I would need a description of the module's operations or a snippet of the module's SystemVerilog code. The description or code should specify what inputs the module receives, what outputs it produces, and how it transforms the inputs into the outputs. The more detailed the description or code, the more accurately I can fill in the operations section of the prompt.

USER:
Can you give me a prompt which will tell a large language model to generate the operations?  Be sure to include a section where I can copy and paste Verilog code or additonal description

GPT4:
Sure, here's a prompt that you can use:

"Given the following SystemVerilog code for a module, please describe the operations that the module performs. The operations should include the input and output ports involved and the expected behavior.

verilog

// Paste your SystemVerilog code here

Based on the operations, please create a PyTest test function that verifies the correct operation of this module. The test function should include test vectors that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. Please also provide a brief explanation of what each test vector is testing.

The test function should have the following structure:

python

def test_module():
  # Define the model
  model = ...

  # Define the test vectors
  test_vectors = [
    # Test vector format: (inputs, expected outputs)
    ...
  ]

  # Run the test vectors
  run_test_vector_sim(model, test_vectors)

Please also provide a brief explanation of what each test vector is testing."

You can replace the comment "// Paste your SystemVerilog code here" with your actual SystemVerilog code or additional description. The large language model should be able to analyze the code or description and generate the operations and test function based on it.
